A step by step guide to wot I done to get prototype #2 working

## install Raspberry PI

Get an 8Gb SD card and a windows SD card reader.

Download the [latest image](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads).

Download [WinDisk Imager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download).

Upack the raspberry zip and use WindDisk Imager to write the .img file to the SDCard.

^^ this is a standard Raspberry PI install step

## boot PI

hook up all the mouse keyboard and monitor - we manually setup the PI image.

Once this is done - we can copy the SD card for furture installs.

### PI Config Menu

#### expand file system

#### set password
to red5leader - the default PI password

#### Finish -> Reboot


### mobile simcard

I went off to three to re-activate the sim-card for the mobile broadband.

This meant finding the last 6 digits on the sim and registering the sim-card.

Now I can top-up for data usage.

Prototype #3 should have a bluetooth so data can go via phone for data - getting people to keep sim-cards updated is a pain.


### buy pi camera board and bits

things I need:

 * camera board for PI
 * sound card for PI
 * gyroscope
