Track Day # 2
-------------

We just got back from a rain sodden [Castle Combe Circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Combe_Circuit) after a wonderfully thrilling track day in our plucky little [Peugeot 205 GTI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_205).

I learnt about grip today.

We spent the morning feeling very safe, even though it was super slippy and Castle Combe is a man's circuit - our car was running like a dog.

You could not see the far end of the track for mist but shit, you could hear our car chunking up the back straight making the farmers tractor envious of the growl it was making.

BUT - the car was running, we knew there was a real lack of power but we were getting round the track and there wern't any oil leaks (which pretty much turned the first track day into a lack day - fun though it was).

A whole bunch of "hmmm, right, so it's not this so it could be that" and we even had the fuel jet out of the carbs (Danger Mouse!)

We were having fun though and over lunch we were doing some more of the 'it could be' game.

Another run after lunch and the tractor was back and we were now thinking "shiiiiiiiit - our car is rubbish and we don't even know why"

The overwhelming summary was:

		No matter what I do I can't get the car faster than 80 Mph

It was only then - after hours of deliberation and fruitless 'problem' solving - did we realize that we had gotten 2 of the 4 HT leads plugged in the wrong way round - a classic school boy error.

To be clear - this is akin to putting a kettle into the fridge and then stood there wondering why it wasn't boiling the water.

It basically meant - that for the whole of the day up until that point - our shitty little tractor had only been running on 2 of it's 4 cylinders.

I say again - we were running on HALF power.

One nano-second later and the car was purring like the beast that was hiding under the bonnet the whole time along - only now it had woken up, was pissed off and was ready to teach some lame-ass humans about a concept they had not yet seen that day - 'horse power'.

The next few hours involved multiple spins, lots of wobbles and grass being collected all around the car with visible skid marks post-event.

Two seperate drivers at different corners were heading directly towards a barrier either backwards or sideways and running the apology speech for having wrecked the car through their head before realising, somewhat churlishly, that they had gotten away with it.

Be-Jesus it was fun.

Oh My Daaaays our car is faaaaaast.

It was REALLY hard to drive in the wet though because it has TOO MUCH POWER.

Our celebratory pint - for not having ruined the car, felt good.

The overwhelming summary was:

		Our car is sooo darn wicked and bad that it can do 80 Mph on only 2 of it's 4 cylinders : )
